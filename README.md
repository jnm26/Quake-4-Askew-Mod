# Quake-4-Askew-Mod
In this mod, players can experience a wilder, weirder way to play Quake 4...

Interesting changes:
Every polygon in the game world is skewed by a certain factor, causing heads to stretch, animations to move in odd ways, and my personal favorite: the reticle is not where your weapon will fire! You'll need to keep an eye on your gun's muzzle to get an idea of where you're firing :)

Gravity is different! All of the game's gravity is tilted by 45 degrees on the x axis. Walls become floors and some floors become walls, not to mention objects in the scene moving in crazy ways!

Some fun weapon mods - there are a bunch, but an interesting one is the machine gun. Land a headshot and you'll one shot just about anything. Good luck aiming with everything skewed, though! Meanwhile, spraying won't get you very far

The more you fire, the sooner you'll lose. With everything going wacky in the Quake 4 world, completing each level is a challenge to click as little as possible. Make those shots count. The armor gauge ticks down to 0 whenever you're firing a weapon (pressing left click). Once it hits zero, you'll die!

Have fun!
